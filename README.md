m0116-remap
===========

KeyRemap4Macbook setup for Apple M0116 accessed through Griffin iMate

Requires OSX, KeyRemap4Macbook (https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/ https://github.com/tekezo/KeyRemap4MacBook)

Remaps only for keyboards attached via an iMate (we can't detect any further than that, sadly, so you probably don't want this if you haven't got an M0116 or very similar attached)

The following keys are remapped:

- Danish Dollar (ยง) -> Backquote  (on my UK model M0116, the backtick key shows up as Danish Dollar)
- Keypad Clear      -> Forward Delete
- Caps-[1-0]        -> F[1-10]
- Caps-Keypad-*     -> Mute
- Caps-Keypad-+     -> Volume up
- Caps-Keypad--     -> Volume Down
